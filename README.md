## Run Demo Site
This project was bootstrapped with create-react-library so...

Local development is broken into two parts.

First, you'll run rollup to watch your src/ module and automatically recompile it into dist/ whenever you make changes.

```bash
npm start # runs rollup with watch flag 
```

The second part will be running the example/ create-react-app that's linked to the local version of your module.

```bash
# (in another tab) 
cd example
npm link <your-module-name> # optional if using yarn 
npm start # runs create-react-app dev server 
```

Now, anytime you make a change to your component in src/ or to the example app's example/src, create-react-app will live-reload your local dev server so you can iterate on your component in real-time.

#### Components
* Buttons
* Dropdowns
* Forms
* Cards
* Tables
* Modals
* Navs

## TODO
* Put the "styles" in place that's accessible, these would currently need to be copied from the example `base.css` file
  * Grid
  * Typography
  * Utility
* Responsiveness
* Don't use props as initial state
* Convert styles to be CSS Modules
* Document each component with sample code

## Release Notes

#### 1.2.0
* Updated table styles to include a `condensed` class as well as a `footer` prop option
* Updated table to support a `title` prop option to show above table headers
* Added a pagination/filter demo to the example docs for tables
  * _NOTE: Pagination/Filtering is not a functional option of the `Table` component, but it is fairly simple to implement, as the example shows_
* Added a `small` class to the `Input` component

### 1.3.0
* Add styles to slide modal in from right
  * Updated modal styles to be position `fixed`, be sure to set `--root-overflow: hidden` when showing (so the background content does not scroll)
* Fix nav underline margin
* Add `Switch` (checkbox)
